This site is a low key blog with a focus on science and programming. In addition
to the enjoyment of running a blog and server, writing articles helps to fully
understand a topic. Explaining something is a good way to learn what you don't
know. And it's often just generally enjoyable.

The original domain of the site was mxbutterfly.net, inspired by the magic emacs
command "M-x butterfly", a joke originating from [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/378/)
about the optimal way to write software (and do anything, really).

The site was founded by a couple fun scientists; one computer, one
biomedical.

It was originally built on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) and hosted on an
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) server from a residential Comcast account,
but the tricks to maintain a clean site with port forwarding and a dynamic IP
quickly got less fun, so it migrated to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). At the end of 2015, it moved from
Pages to [another VPS](https://nerdster.org/nerdsters-new-digs/) to take
advantage of Let's Encrypt's free certificate offerings.

Also thanks to [mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) for a
great starting point on the theme. This site's source is also available on
[Github](https://github.com/stevejarvis/stevejarvis.github.io).
