There are, like, [a lot](https://www.coloradobrewerylist.com/brewery/)
of breweries in Colorado, and many are within biking distance of
Denver. We're going to start a series of fun and friendly rides to
visit some of 'em. There is no major plan, where we head on any given
day depends totally on who's coming and what the group feels like
doing.

The map below gives a bit of an interactive journal of where we've been so far.
