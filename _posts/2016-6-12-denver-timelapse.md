    <figcaption>Full loop of all images taken so far. Images are automatically added as
    they are taken, currently every three hours (except middle of the night). Perspective
    is looking north/northwest from
    Cheesman Park, Denver.</figcaption>

Basically, this is a jailbroken iPhone running iOS 8.1.3, [Activator](http://www.cydiaios7.com/activator.html), Activator Command, and git.
Images are taken on a schedule by Activator, added to the repository for this site, and
a git post-receive hook on the server (the same that builds the rest of the site) assembles
the images into the above gif with [convert](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php).
