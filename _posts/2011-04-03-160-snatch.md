I hadn't even attempted a personal best lift in two years, and being back at
these weights feels awesome. This weight (160 kg snatch) has been running
through my head for so long, and it was this close! This week was a great week
of training in all. I was similarly close to a best clean and jerk a couple days
prior.

So no actual records were set, but I feel pretty good about the lifts
anyway, and I'm in a great place going to the Collegiate Nationals next
weekend. There'll be other great lifters there ready to battle it out and I look
forward to it. I'm glad to be competing well again and I'm excited to see
beautiful Shreveport.
