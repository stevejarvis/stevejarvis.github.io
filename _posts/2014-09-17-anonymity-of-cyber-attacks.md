title: The Anonymity of Cyber Attacks

but it's certainly difficult to cover all the tracks."

One of the commonly cited benefits of cyber attacks over conventional warfare is
the anonymity with which actions can be taken. There's a fine line
between military action and criminal activity, and many of the same pros and
cons are relevant for each. It's surely hard to pinpoint those responsible for shady
online activity, but doable, and there's often some interesting clues left behind.

Stuxnet was perhaps the most advanced cyber weapon seen to date, and it was a
suspected collaboration between the US and Israel for reasons including the
[celebration of its success at the retirement of Former
Chief of General Staff of Israeli Defense Forces][telegraph_gabi] and
[an article outlining an attack precisely like Stuxnet][bumgarner_article]
written by a retired US Army special operations veteran. Finally, and most conclusively,
[Snowden confirmed Stuxnet was a joint effort between the US and Israel][snowden_stuxnet].

Another instance of serious cyber action was the BlackPOS malware, the virus that afflicted Target this
past year. It was found to be written by a Russian teenager. Some of the
evidence that led to his being caught included accidentally [displaying a
link to his social network profile in a video demonstrating the malware][sec_affairs_blackpos]
and [using a personal domain in connection with the exploit][sec_affairs_domain].

Tracking down the Stuxnet and BlackPOS authors required some technical and
political know-how, or at least how to navigate Russian black market sites for
malware. That takes some doing.

On the flip side, I've found it almost comically interesting how much
simpler it was to suspect China and Iran in recent cyber attacks. The [tools
China used for attacking American organizations][nytimes_china_attacks] and the
[activity on the social networking accounts used to steal identities][nytimes_iran_attacks]
were updated during the standard working hours of China and Iran,
respectively. Even internet criminals like to get home for dinner.
