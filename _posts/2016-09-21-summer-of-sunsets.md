Many of the technical details have changed since this
[started](../denver-timelapse), because free hosting services don't
like multi-gigabyte repositories, a Raspberry Pi can't crunch 1000
images into a mp4, and Instagram is apparently _really_ good at
detecting bot accounts, but the overall goal's the same and the iPhone
is still snappin' away.

We're just over 3 months in, and the cool thing is it's more or less
precisely the summer months. So here's a timelapse of the last ninety
8:00 PM snaps.

Personally, I found it surprising and initially a bit confusing that
there's _so much_ variation between days. I was convinced the clock
was wrong in the exif data, but slight variations in the weather just
make big differences in a picture.
