### Updates

* 8/25/2011 – Finger Paint is now all but Pro Paint; it’s got everything.
* 8/5/2011 – There’s a new version, but more importantly, there’s a whole new app! The pro version just launched. <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.sajarvis.paint" target="_blank">See it here.</a>
* 6/13/2011 – Seems there was a problem with the Market after that upgrade. After the download stats didn’t change for a week I got curious and found the app was completely missing from the Market, yet it was still listed as “Published” in the Console. I’m not sure what happened, but a unpublish and republish cycle cleared it up.
* 6/7/2011 – Upgrade! Version 1.5 submitted to the market. It’s only 1.5, but it’s twice as cool. The changes are substantial; a new color picker makes all kinds of colors available, more brushes to use, recalls brush and color choice across sessions, can clear the painting, and general improvements to the interface.

### A Few Words

I set out to learn more about Android (and Java) graphics by writing a finger painting app. After my first go laid strings of unconnected dots, I went looking for a better approach. I came across the example in the Android SDK and started expanding on that. So, coincidentally, the part I was looking to learn by writing was the part handed to me. Modifying it demanded I understand it though, and who better to learn from than the Google engineers?

Generally, the features added are these:

* Save and share your creation (with notifications)
* Random color by shaking the phone
* Brush size selector
* Way more… See the updates!
