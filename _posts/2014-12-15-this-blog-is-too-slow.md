### Big Pics Make Bad Load Times

[Jenny](http://www.nerdster.org/jenny-jarvis/) has one of those fancy
cameras and takes beautiful, high resolution photos. They're nice to
look at, but a 150 million pixel blog post adds more to load times than it does
to viewing quality.<sup>1</sup> Specifically, a fetch of Jenny's
[latest post](http://www.nerdster.org/Helsinki/) took a painful 13 seconds:

{% highlight bash %}
$ wget --page-requisites http://www.nerdster.org/Helsinki/
[ ... ]
FINISHED --2014-12-15 19:24:14--
Total wall clock time: 18s
Downloaded: 24 files, 36M in 13s (2.83 MB/s)
{% endhighlight %}

It's a photo-rich article, but regardless, it has to be faster than that.

### Slimming Down

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and generated by Jekyll, so you can see the
[entire source](https://github.com/stevejarvis/stevejarvis.github.io) if you're
interested, but the relevant matters are that pics are stored in the
"./images/" folder and Jenny saves photos with the ".JPG" extension.

The disk usage utility revealed that we had a grand total of 104 MB of images
on the site:

{% highlight bash %}
$ du -hs images/
104M
{% endhighlight %}

That includes all of it, not only Jenny's photos, but a quick
browse of the directory showed that her's account for the majority.
The quick perusing also revealed that most image files were either smaller than
~500 KB or larger than ~2 MB. Given that, 1 MB seemed like a reasonable line to
draw and I scaled down all larger files with the following Bash:<sup>2</sup>

{% highlight bash %}
$ for f in `find images -size +1M`; do sips --resampleHeightWidthMax 1024 $f; done
{% endhighlight %}

After mowing down all the huge pics, the entire images folder shrunk by over
90%. That's even better than I'd hoped for.

{% highlight bash %}
$ du -hs images/
9.5M
{% endhighlight %}

See commit
[a4e80](https://github.com/stevejarvis/stevejarvis.github.io/commit/a4e8010cbcd66fb61ac3dcf24e4355c75a167b81)
for the entire resultant changelist.

### Now We're Fast(er)

After pushing those changes, fetching the entire page took 2 seconds; about a
85% speedup. A 2 second page load might not win many awards, but it's an enormous
improvement and not half bad.

{% highlight bash %}
$ wget --page-requisites http://www.nerdster.org/Helsinki/
[ ... ]
FINISHED --2014-12-15 19:51:16--
Total wall clock time: 4.7s
Downloaded: 24 files, 3.8M in 2.0s (1.84 MB/s)
{% endhighlight %}

1. I'm thinking of a page with ten 15M images. Rough guess at the pixel
count, the point is it's a lot.
2. sips (scriptable image processing system) is OS X specific.
