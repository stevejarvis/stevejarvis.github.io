  bio: "I spend a lot of time cycling and racing bikes around the Twin Cities. I studied CS and love building 
  software -- particularly the aspects of performance & security -- and am currently professionally security-focused 
  and figuring out what a leader is supposed to do. And I actually love coffee."
