# Who's a Teapot?
This site's domain, "iamteapot", is an obscure reference to the 418 HTTP code[^1].  It may have 
started as an April Fool's joke, with the RFC published April 1, 1998[^2], but to me (and many 
others[^3]) it's a quintessential example of how fun and tangible the Internet can be.

This is not a place governed by a few large corporations or any single governing body, 
it's built by "us" -- the collective we who use and care about it -- and we have the 
ability to make it whatever we want it to be. It may not seem this way all the time, with the 
Internet's clicks and traffic[^4] being further consolidated to just a few big players, but 
that's kind of my point! The Internet is a project of the people, and all those who care to 
have a voice and influence in its direction are able to do so. Say, for example, that you envision 
a better way to brew coffee. That's a beautiful thing.
